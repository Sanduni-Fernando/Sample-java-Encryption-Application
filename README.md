# Data Encryption and Decryption 
Encryption is the process of translating a meaningful, readable data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (cipher text).
Decryption is the process of converting cipher text back to plain text.
The primary purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality of digital data stored on computer systems or transmitted via the internet or other computer networks. Modern Encryption algorithms play a vital role in the security assurance of IT systems and communications as they can provide not only the confidentiality, but also authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation.
# Getting Started
If you want to just run the program, you can download AESEncryption.jar file.
